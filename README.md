In this repository, I have used HTML, CSS and PHP for a sports system and the data will be stored in a database(mysql).

In this system, you can create, update and delete a football team. Also, you can add, update and delete a player in a team. This changes will be saved in the database.

This system is very usable, the main page has a dashboard to be as a guide for the user. Also, the system has a header, main and footer.
